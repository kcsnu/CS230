For this project, my client, The Gaming Room, asked me to expand their Android game, Draw It or Lose It, into a distributed, web-based application. Their key requirements included support for multiple platforms, real-time interaction among multiple teams and players, ensuring unique identifiers for games, teams, and players, and maintaining only a single game instance in memory.

In developing this documentation, I particularly did well at clearly articulating the use and purpose of design patterns such as Singleton and Iterator, which were critical to meeting the client's needs. I also clearly showed how core object-oriented programming ideas, including inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and composition, were applied to the domain model, making the roles and relationships between classes easy to understand.

Writing the design document helped me a lot because it forced me to organize my thoughts and approach the project more methodically. Breaking down each part of the system early helped me catch dependencies and possible issues before starting to code, making the development process much smoother.

If I were to revise one area of my documentation, I would add more detail on how to handle concurrency and performance. Specifically, I'd show specific ways to manage multiple simultaneous user requests, like using threads or synchronization Additionally, a system architecture diagram could further clarify interactions and data flow, offering a visual supplement to the textual descriptions.

To meet the user's needs, I carefully reviewed their requirements and translated them directly into design choices. Using patterns like Singleton and Iterator made sure these needs were met consistently. Staying focused on the user's goals is critical because even technically sound software can fail if it doesn't deliver what users actually need.

Overall, my design approach combined iterative development with clear UML diagrams to keep everything organized. In future projects, I plan to add even more practical details early on, especially about concurrency and user experience, and bring in user feedback throughout the design process to stay closely aligned with their expectations.
